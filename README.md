# Awesome Battleships
Awesome Battleships is a python game that runs on a mock command line terminal on Heroku. It's a one-on-one game in which you compete against the computer.
You and the computer battle to sink each other's ships, which are distributed across a grid.
Each ship occupies a single point on the grid.

## How To Play
The player will be prompted to enter a grid size for their own and the computer's grids when the game begins. They can only choose between 4 and 10. Then the player and computer's ships are placed on the grid, but only the player's ships are visible to them, while the computer's remain hidden. The player's ships are indicated with a dollar sign ($).
When they make a correct guess, it is indicated by an 'o', and when they make a wrong guess, it is marked by a 'x' on the computer's grid. The other points on the grids are made up of plus symbols (+). The winner is the one who destroys all of their opponent's ships. It is possible for the game to end in a draw if all ships are cleared in the same round.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Grid size set
  - The grid size can be set at the start of the game
  - The choice is between 4 and 10
  - The player grid and computer grid will be sized the same
  - Warns player if their choice is not between 4 and 10

- Random grid generation
  - Ships are placed randomly on the player and computer grids
  - Player's ships are denoted with a dollar sign '$'
  - Computer's ships are not visible to the player

- turn based gameplay
  - Computer can makes guesses after player's guess
  - Score is revealed every turn
  - Player is prompted to give their guess on each turn

- Input validation and error-checking
  - Player is unable to enter coordinates that are outside the grid size. 
  - Player can only input numbers for guesses
  - Player is unable to make the same gueess twice

### Future Features
- Larger ships that can take up more points on the grid
- Option to change ship axis
- More ships for larger grids size options
- Special ships that reward more points when destroyed

## Data Model
For the battleship game project I went with a funcional programming data model. I use 3 classes, the Game class, Player classs, and Computer class to set up the game. I then make 3 grid class intances from them. Whick I used with functions to display the grids how I want to them to be displayed. I also used functions that add ships to the grids and calculate the guesses to return the results to the grid and score the player and computer based on the results.

## Testing
I tested that the game works through a variety of methods:
- I used the pep8 linter and confirmed there are no problems
- I inputed random letters when prompted for number inputs
- I input coordinates that were out of range
- I typed in negative numbers
- I also used duplicate guesses

### Bugs

### Solved bugs
- I had issues with my try exceptions not picking up on value error exceptions when I was testing the game. It turns out I had not indented my code correctly by having both spaces and tabs mixed in. I fixed it by deleting all the white space and only indendting with 4 spaces.

- I had originally used the random randint function to pick a random row and colums to place the ships on, but it would repeat iself sometimes and place ships in the same location. I fixed this by using the random sample funcion instead. Which creates a random list with no duplicates that I used to index the location of the ships to be placed.

## Validator Testing
- PEP8
  - No errors were returned from [pep8online validator.](pep8online.com)

### Unfixed Bugs
No unfixed bugs
